            My hobby is creative and lets your mind relax. Hi my name is Sahana Parabakar and I am 12 years old. My hobby is drawing. I like drawing beacause it letsa your mind wander and be free. Also, no one can say anything about it beacause art is litterly anything. I t can be grass, the sky, a face, and belive it or not even a stinky old mud covered shoe!

        I have done many different drawings. Like the one below this. I started drawing since I was in 5th. I loved art ever since kindergarten. I continued it and I get better and better every day. As long as I try hard and keep practicing. Below you can find some nice art work.
